If you are unfamiliar with this problem, check out <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon's_needle' target=blank>this page</a> or <a href = 'http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BuffonsNeedleProblem.html' target=blank>Wolfram Alpha</a>. The actual problem invovles a pretty interesting experiment as well as a compelling proof. However, the more intriguing part of it is that this experiment can be used in order to approximate pi. I made a program that simulates this experiment for a chosen number of times and for a chosen number of toothpicks of given length. After, the results of each trial is averaged for a pi approximation. It uses a random number generator and probability involved in this problem. I made this to accompany my final project in AP Statistics.</br><b>Requires: </b>Python 3 (for .py file) OR 64-bit system (for executable) (Click button to download) </span>"),

This is based on the 4.0 scale. In addition, custom weighting for AP, Honors, and Academic Classes can be set for a weighted version of the scale. It is also based off a block schedule so their are only four classes.
