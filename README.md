What's the big idea?
------------------------

This site was created by me, Somil Govani. I am a high school student with an interest in various computer applications. This site was made for a few reasons. For one, I wanted a medium to share some of my work in programming due to my interest in computer science. But also, I wanted to try my hand at web design. So, in a way, I guess I'm killing two birds with one code.

I am by no means an "expert programmer", I'm just trying a few things out. You'll find things from every respect on here, whether it may be Python, Java, TI-BASIC or even PowerPoint! Every now and then I may even share some things that I find interesting on the internet. Who knows?

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or requests.
